The Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of the Knowledge
All things work together for those who are called according to His purpose

The Lord is Gracious towards the FAtherless and Orphans
Pray Continually

God so loved the World,that he gave his only begotten son

that whosoever believeth on Him shall not perish but have an Everlasting Life


The effective fervent prayer of a man availeth much

God is good
